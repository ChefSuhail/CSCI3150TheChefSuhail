            <h2>The Case for Universal Design</h2>
            <p>Universal design ensures that everyone, regardless of ability, can engage with the digital world. With over a billion people living with disabilities globally, it’s our responsibility as designers and developers to create inclusive experiences.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Accessibility is a Right</h3>
            <p>Everyone deserves equal access to the internet, a critical resource for education, work, and daily life. By designing inclusively, we uphold the principles of fairness and equality.</p>

            <h3>2. Beneficial for Everyone</h3>
            <p>Universal design not only helps those with disabilities but also improves usability for all users. Features like responsive design, voice commands, and captioned videos benefit a wide audience, including older adults and users in diverse environments.</p>

            <h3>3. Expanding Your Reach</h3>
            <p>Accessible websites reach a larger audience, including people with disabilities and those using assistive technologies. This expands your user base and builds a more inclusive community.</p>

            <h3>4. Legal and Ethical Responsibility</h3>
            <p>Governments worldwide are enacting stricter accessibility laws. Designing universally helps avoid legal challenges while showcasing your ethical commitment to inclusion.</p>
