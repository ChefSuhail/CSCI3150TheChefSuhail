            <h2>Understanding Universal Design</h2>
            <p>
                Universal design is the practice of creating products and environments that can be used by everyone, regardless of their age, abilities, or circumstances. In the context of web development, it means designing websites that are accessible, usable, and inclusive.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Principles of Universal Design</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Equitable Use:</strong> The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility in Use:</strong> The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple and Intuitive Use:</strong> The design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience or knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Perceptible Information:</strong> The design communicates necessary information effectively, regardless of ambient conditions or sensory abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Tolerance for Error:</strong> The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Physical Effort:</strong> The design can be used efficiently and comfortably with minimal fatigue.</li>
                <li><strong>Size and Space for Approach and Use:</strong> Appropriate size and space are provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use, regardless of the user's body size or mobility.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Why Does It Matter?</h3>
            <p>
                Universal design benefits everyone, not just people with disabilities. By creating inclusive designs, you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure usability across diverse user groups.</li>
                <li>Improve user satisfaction and engagement.</li>
                <li>Comply with accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).</li>
                <li>Future-proof your designs against changing user needs.</li>
            </ul>
