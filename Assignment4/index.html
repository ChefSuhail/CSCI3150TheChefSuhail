        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Compared with the previous generation, the Golf Mk7 has a more spacious cabin with greater shoulder room for the front and rear passengers, more rear legroom, and a larger boot space. 
            It is 20 mm (0.8 in) wider than the Mk6, with a 59 mm (2.3 in) longer wheelbase. 
            Engine options at launch include 1.2 and 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engines, with 85 PS (63 kW; 84 hp) and 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp) respectively, and 1.6 and 2.0-litre diesel engines, with 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) and 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) respectively.
            The 1.6 TDI BlueMotion Concept has a theoretical combined fuel consumption of 3.2 L/100 km (88 mpg‑imp; 74 mpg‑US) and anticipated 85 g/km CO2 emissions. 
            Available body styles are three and five-door hatchbacks (including high-performance Golf GTI and Golf R models), and a five-door estate (known as the SportWagen in the United States, first advertised in May 2015). 
            Sales of the three-door hatchback were not as strong as previous generations, and it was dropped with the launch of the eighth generation model in late 2019. 
            A van version based on the three-door Golf was sold only in Ireland to commercial customers and was cancelled as corporations opted for the bigger Volkswagen Caddy. 
            At launch in the US market, Volkswagen also offered the Golf Sport model. 
            Around 650 of these SE four-door models were built, equipped with a six-speed automatic transmission. 
            Offered in either Pure White or Platinum Gray, the Sport model is visually enhanced with a body kit that includes a front lip spoiler, side skirts, a rear valence, a larger rear spoiler, and chrome exhaust tips. 
            The Golf went on sale in the UK in early January and was released in Australia in April 2013. 
            In Brazil, the Golf Mk7 went on sale in September 2013, only in the High-line and GTI trims, along with the Comfortline trim, which was made available from March 2014. 
            All models were imported from Germany until 2015, when local assembly commenced. 
            At its introduction in 2013, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award, the first time it was awarded to a European product.</p>

        <h2>e-Golf</h2>
        <p>The production version of the 2014 Volkswagen e-Golf was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. 
            On 14 February 2014, Volkswagen launched sales of the e-Golf in Germany. 
            In Norway, the e-Golf became available for pre-order on 25 February 2014 for delivery in June 2014. 
            On 11 March 2014, Volkswagen opened ordering for the e-Golf in the UK with deliveries began at the end of June. 
            Production of vehicles destined for retail customers began in March 2014. 
            U.S. sales started in selected states in November 2014 with a single SEL Premium model for the 2015 model year.
            Volkswagen stopped sales of the e-Golf in the UK in 2021.</p>

            <section id="GTE">
                <h3>Golf GTE</h3>
        
                <img src="Assignment4/img/BLACKGTE.jpg" alt="BLACKGTE" style="max-width: 100%;">

                <p class="sr-only">This is a detailed description of the Volkswagen Golf that is hidden visually but available to screen readers for users who need it.</p>


                <p>The Golf GTE plug-in hybrid is driven by two power sources: a 1.4-litre 110 kW (150 PS; 148 hp) TSI direct-injection petrol engine and a 75 kW (102 hp) electric motor. 
                    Together, they combine to produce power of 150 kW (204 PS; 201 hp) and 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft) of torque, with a theoretical range of 827 km (514 mi). 
                    Using the electric motor alone, the GTE is capable of speeds of 130 km/h (81 mph). 
                    With the TSI engine as well, the Golf GTE can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 7.6 seconds and on to a top speed of 215 km/h (134 mph). 
                    The Golf GTE shares the basic powertrain hardware with the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron but the software controls are different. 
                    The Golf GTE also shares the same plug-in hybrid powertrain with the Volkswagen Passat GTE, but the Passat has a larger 9.9 kWh Li-ion battery pack.
                    In EV mode, the Golf GTE has an official all-electric range of 50 km (31 mi) but in real world testing will often get around 35 km (22 mi) to 39 km (24 mi) miles of range.
                    Under the New European Driving Cycle, combined fuel economy is 1.50 L/100 km (157 mpg‑US) equivalent. The electric power can also be saved—for example when driving to a zero-emissions zone. The 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery can be charged in around three and a half hours from a domestic mains outlet, or two and a half hours from a domestic wallbox. 
                    The battery weighs 120 kg (265 lb), giving the GTE a total kerb weight of 1,520 kg (3,351 lb).
                    The car has 4 (or on some older models 5) driving modes.
                    The car will always starts in all-electric mode (unless the battery has very low charge), a button beside the gear stick allows the driver to select between: Hybrid drive, Which allows the car to switch between electric drive and the petrol motor when driving. 
                    Charge Mode; which uses energy from the petrol engine to recharge the car's battery. 
                    Battery Hold Mode, which solely uses the petrol engine to save battery power (only available on older models) and back to Electric mode. 
                    The final option called 'GTE Mode' has a separate button beside the gear stick which allows the car to use both the petrol engine and the electric motor for a punchy performance.
                    The Golf GTE uses a six-speed DSG gearbox with a triple-clutch system specially developed for hybrid vehicles. 
                    The electric motor is integrated into the gearbox housing, while further hybrid components include power electronics and a charger. An electro-mechanical brake servo and an electric air conditioning compressor make for energy-efficient braking and air conditioning.
                    Volkswagen claims a 0.299 drag coefficient.
                    Inside as on the outside, the Golf GTE features blue highlights where the GTI has red. 
                    This includes stitching on the steering wheel, gear lever gaiter and seats, and a blue stripe in the tartan pattern on the sports seats. 
                    It includes bespoke functions for electric vehicles, including the ability to identify potential destinations on electric range, and electric charging points. The GTE will also feature an e-manager which allows the driver to preset vehicle charging as well as interior cooling or heating. 
                    These functions can also be operated remotely using the Volkswagen Car-Net app on a smartphone: a three-year subscription will be included in the UK.
                    The first GTE units were registered in Germany in August 2014, and it was the second-best selling plug-in hybrid in Europe in 2015 with 17,282 sales.</p>

                <p>The Golf Mk7 GTD is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged common rail diesel engine with 184 PS (135 kW; 181 hp). 
                    Maximum torque has risen from 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft) to 380 N⋅m (280 lb⋅ft) from 1,750 rpm. 
                    The Golf R, in comparison, has 380 N⋅m (280 lb⋅ft) from 1,800 rpm. 
                    Acceleration from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) takes 7.5 seconds, while the top speed is 227 km/h (141 mph). 
                    The GTD has a combined fuel consumption of 4.18 L/100 km; 56.2 mpg‑US (67.5 mpg‑imp), making for CO2 emissions of only 109 g/km. 
                    With the optional six-speed DSG, fuel consumption is 4.50 L/100 km; 52.3 mpg‑US (62.8 mpg‑imp) and CO2 emissions of 119 g/km. 
                    For comparison, when the first generation Golf BlueMotion went on sale at the end of 2007, it had the same fuel economy and CO2 emissions.</p>

            The standard GTI accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds and can reach a top speed of 250 km/h. 
            The GTI Performance has a top speed of 250 km/h and accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.4 seconds.
            Both versions of the GTI are equipped with a start-stop system and fulfil 2014 Euro 6 emissions standards. 
            With a six-speed manual gearbox, they attain the same low fuel consumption value of 47.1 mpg‑imp (6.00 L/100 km) (CO2 emissions of 139 g/km. 
            This means that the latest Golf GTI offers an 18 percent improvement in fuel economy compared to the previous model. 
            With the optional six-speed DSG gearbox, the two GTI models achieve fuel consumption figures of 44.1 mpg‑imp (6.41 L/100 km) (equivalent to 148 g/km CO2 for the standard GTI and 149 g/km CO2 for the GTI Performance).

            <p>Volkswagen introduced the special-edition GTI Clubsport for 2016, coinciding with the GTI's 40th anniversary. The Clubsport was not available in the United States. 
                On the exterior, the Clubsport features a revised front fascia, more aggressive rear hatch spoiler, new rear diffuser with larger exhaust tips, and a black stripe along the lower sides of the body. 
                Inside the car, the Clubsport is equipped with bucket seats and an Alcantara steering wheel and shift lever. 
                The Clubsport uses the same 2.0-litre EA888 turbocharged inline-4 as the standard GTI which has been revised to produce 261 horsepower, with up to 286 horsepower for 10 seconds at a time via an included overboost feature which raises the engine's boost pressure by 0.2 bar, up to 2.1 bar. 
                Transmission choices remain the same as the standard GTI, with both the 6-speed manual and 6-speed DSG available, both equipped with the standard GTI's optional limited-slip differential. 
                Weight is listed as 1,375 kg. 
                The Clubsport was available from the factory with optional Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires. 
                The official 0-to-60 time is quoted as 5.9 seconds, 0.6 seconds quicker than the standard GTI with Performance Package.

            <p>The 3-door GTI Clubsport S was a limited-edition version of the GTI Clubsport sold as a higher-strung version optimized for faster track times. 
                Only 400 were produced for the 2016 model year. 
                Upgrades from the Clubsport to the Clubsport S include new front suspension and subframe components, updated suspension alignment, upgraded brakes, a more highly-strung version of the GTI's 2.0L EA888 turbocharged inline-4, using the larger IHI IS38 turbocharger instead of the IS20, that produces 310 PS (228 kW; 306 hp) and 385 N⋅m (39 kg⋅m; 284 lb⋅ft) of torque, standard Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 track-oriented tires, removal of the rear seats and some sound deadening, and a quoted weight of 2,998 pounds (1,360 kg). 
                The result of these modifications is a lap time of 7 minutes, 49.21 seconds around the Nürburgring Nordschleife track, 1.4 seconds faster than the Honda Civic Type R, which held the previous record for a front-wheel drive production car. 
                The Clubsport S was released with an estimated base price of £35,000.

        <p class="sr-only">This is a detailed description of the Volkswagen Golf that is hidden visually but available to screen readers for users who need it.</p>

        
        <p>Like the GTI, the Golf R is also built as a three- or five-door hatchback and there's also a wagon version. 
            It is powered by a newly developed version of the 1,984 cc (2.0 L; 121.1 cu in) turbocharged EA888 petrol FSI inline-four engine used in the latest Golf GTI, Audi S3, Volkswagen Tiguan and Jetta, and dozens of other Volkswagen AG vehicles, but in this application, it produces 300 PS (221 kW; 296 hp) (or 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) for "hot climate" markets such as Australia, South Africa, Japan, and the US) from 5,500 to 6,200 rpm and 380 N⋅m (280 lb⋅ft) from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm of torque. 
            Compared to the GTI's powerplant, the Golf R's engine has a modified cylinder head, exhaust valves, valve seats and springs, pistons, injection valves and larger intercooler and turbocharger. 
            DSG-equipped models also come with an auxiliary oil cooler on the passenger side on right hand drive models.
            0-62 mph (100  km/h) takes 5.1 seconds (versus 5.7 seconds for the previous Golf R) or 4.9 seconds with the optional DSG gearbox. 
            The top speed is electronically limited to 155 mph (249 km/h). 
            Despite this increased performance, a combined fuel consumption of 39.8 miles per imperial gallon (7.10 L/100 km; 33.1 mpg‑US), and CO2 emissions of 165 g/km and emissions of 159 g/km DSG) make the Golf R up to 18 percent more efficient than its predecessor.
            The R uses an updated, fifth-generation Haldex 4MOTION four-wheel drive system. 
            Under low loads or when coasting, the rear axle is decoupled, helping to reduce fuel consumption. 
            Drive to the rear axle can be engaged in fractions of a second via the Haldex coupling, which is actuated by an electro-hydraulic pump. 
            Up to 50 percent of power can be transferred to the rear axle. 
            A brake-actuated XDS+ system mimics a limited-slip differential by applying the brakes to the wheel with the least traction, this is on both the front and rear axles.
            The ride height is 20 mm lower than the standard Golf. 
            Golf R models equipped with the optional 'DCC' (Dynamic Chassis Control) offer three suspension modes: 'Comfort', 'Normal', and 'Race'. 
            Each mode adjusts the stiffness of the suspension damping, thereby offering drivers a way to change the way the vehicle responds with the push of a button. 
            Comfort mode places the dampers in the softest setting, increasing the absorption of road imperfections and allowing for a smoother and more comfortable ride. 
            Race mode stiffens the dampers to their most aggressive setting, reducing body movements and increasing adhesion to the road for more precise high-speed driving. 
            Race mode also increases throttle response, firms up the steering for a heftier feel, and alters the shift pattern of the DSG gearbox (where fitted), and increases the speed of the Adaptive headlamps (AFS) response time.
            On top of ESC Sport mode, as found on the GTI and GTD, which delays intervention of the electronic stability control system, the R offers the option fully to disengage the ESC, for track driving.
            For the Canadian market, the optional Discover Pro 8" infotainment system is available as part of the single option "Technology Package," while only the 6.5" Discover is available to US consumers. 
            In North America, the Golf R comes standard with halogen tail lights and HID bi-xenon headlights with LED front and side view mirror turn signals, while ROW markets received the options for a sunroof, a three-door version, and LED tail lights. 
            All these features are not available in the North American version. 
            The Golf R and e-Golf are the only Golf models available in North America that was produced in Germany. 
            Other Golf models for the North American market are produced by Volkswagen de México in Puebla, Mexico.
            A limited edition Golf R400 was rumored in August 2015 by Heinz-Jakob Neusser, then-head of brand development, but in the wake of the Volkswagen emissions scandal (and Neusser's suspension) it was cancelled in favor of focusing on the Golf R.
            For the South African market, the Golf R received another upgrade in power in March 2019. 
            The upgrade resulted in 310 PS (228 kW; 306 hp) and 400 N⋅m (41 kg⋅m; 295 lb⋅ft) of torque (up from 290 PS (213 kW; 286 hp) and 380 N⋅m (39 kg⋅m; 280 lb⋅ft) in the facelift seen in July 2017). 
            Additionally, the Golf R was also optionally available with an Akrapovič performance exhaust from the factory.
            The Mk7 Golf R was discontinued in the United States in August 2019.</p>
